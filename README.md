## Features

- Accessibility features

## Installation

### Recommended way

- Go to the [official GNOME Shell Extensions website](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/240/persian-calendar/).
- Click on the “ON/OFF” button on the top-right of the page.
- If you don't see the extension, go to the [troubleshooting section](README.md#troubleshooting).

### For developers

- Clone the repository
- Go to the cloned directory
- run `make` command in the terminal
- Restart GNOME Shell. (ALT+F2, r, Enter OR logout/login)
- You may need to enable the extension via GNOME `Extensions` application

## Troubleshooting

1. I don't see the ON/OFF button, or it's disabled, but I see a blue message on top of the website, with a message like: “To control GNOME Shell extensions using this site you must install GNOME Shell integration that…”. What should I do?
   - In this case, you must install the `gnome-browser-connector` package on your system. For example, on Ubuntu, you should run: `apt install gnome-browser-connector`
2. I enable the extension, but it doesn't appear and when I refresh the page, it's disabled again! Why?!
   - Run `gnome-extensions` application and make sure extensions are enabled and the toggle in front of the extension is turned on also.
